# Quote-Generator

This is a simple quote generator that uses the fetch function in JavaScript to retrieve a random quote from an external API and display it on the page. The API returns a JSON file with a collection of quotes from various authors. The user can click a button to generate a new quote or the page will automatically display a new quote every 10 seconds. Additionally, the user has the option to post the quote on Twitter by clicking the "Tweet" button.
